Anybody mod-related bugs are my responsibility, not others that contribute to the main projects.

DISCLAIMER: NETHER FOLIAGE NOW WAVES! THIS IS NOT A BUG, THIS IS INTENTIONAL!

Overimagined Shaders - Additional Mod Support is a fork of Overimagined Shaders, which is a fork of Complementary Reimagined shaders.
It intends to add proper mod support without any compromises. It is important to note that this project will never be fully complete, as it is
impossible to support every single mod out there. Especially with the limited time that I have on hand. If you want to contribute, go ahead by all means!

I will only support blocks! I will never spend my time dealing with custom dimensions. Too much work!

Declarations of development: I will...
  - Be supporting popular mods first
  - Focus on fabric mods. Some forge mods might be sprinkled in there.
  - State that this is mainly a personal project to fulfill my own needs for mod support.
  - Do my best to make the support as geniune as possible.
  - Most likely be inconsistent as I have a life to deal with.
  - Not tolerate any sorts of demands. E.g. PLZZ ADD SUPPORT FOR X MOD. If you want to enquire about a mod, please be considerate!
